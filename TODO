* invoice creation: user customers instead of user.addresses
* invoices, customers: live-search and sorting for columns
* customer: counter_cache for total invoices and total open invoices
* customer: total gross plus open total gross (both cached)
* multi-user (goldberg)
* Umsatzsteuerbefreiung f√ºr Kleinunternehmer
* upload of logo
* other invoice pdf templates (maybe design a DSL, use textile)
* auto_complete_for customer in invoice form (should save lots of sql load if many customers)
